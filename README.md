# ellipticCurve
Elliptic-curve cryptography is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. 
ECC allows smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography to provide equivalent security.

There is no dependency I jus took the formulation and try to apply in programming syantax.

It was explain in out Cryptography lesson for how it is use to generate public key.
